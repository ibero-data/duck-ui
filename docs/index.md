## What is Duck-UI?

Duck-UI is a modern web interface for **DuckDB**, the fast in-process analytical database. It leverages DuckDB's WebAssembly capabilities to run entirely in your browser, providing a powerful SQL editor and data analysis platform without requiring any server infrastructure.

### Key Features

- ü¶Ü **No Server Required**: DuckDB runs in your browser via WebAssembly
- üìÅ **Import Anything**: Load CSV, JSON, Parquet, Arrow files from local storage or URLs
- üíæ **Persistent Storage**: Save databases using OPFS for data that persists across sessions
- üîå **External Connections**: Connect to remote DuckDB servers when needed
- ‚ö° **Lightning Fast**: Near-native performance thanks to WebAssembly
- üîí **Privacy First**: All data processing happens client-side

## Requirements

- Modern web browser with WebAssembly support:
  - Chrome/Edge 88+
  - Firefox 79+
  - Safari 14+
- Docker (for containerized deployment) or Bun/Node.js 20+ (for building from source)
- **No database server needed** for local WASM mode

## Use Cases

### Data Analysis

Analyze CSV, JSON, or Parquet files directly in your browser without uploading to a server:

```sql
SELECT product, SUM(sales) as total_sales
FROM read_csv('sales_data.csv')
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

### Quick Prototyping

Test SQL queries and data transformations without setting up infrastructure:

```sql
-- Load data from URL
CREATE TABLE products AS
SELECT * FROM read_parquet('https://example.com/products.parquet');

-- Run analytics
SELECT category, AVG(price) as avg_price
FROM products
GROUP BY category;
```

### Learning SQL

Perfect environment for learning SQL with instant feedback and no setup:

- Import sample datasets
- Write queries with autocomplete
- See results immediately
- No database configuration needed
